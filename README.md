# Booking-Without-App

## Problem Statement: 
The ability to book a Namma Yatri auto could open up more demand. Build innovative tech solutions to let customers book an auto without installing the app - E.g. website, WhatsApp, SMS, Phone etc. This will cater to users who are uncomfortable or unwilling to use Apps.

## Solution Scope & Deliverables: 
Namma Yatri is a community-led platform and has a decentralized operations model. Therefore, setting up a large call center for accepting bookings is unviable. All the Namma Yatri drivers use an open/backend tech platform that can interoperate with any customer-side request. Tech has to solve the booking experience on the user side. 

## Broad solution themes:
1. Web-App / Website based booking
2. Simplified booking using WhatsApp or SMS
3. Direct phone call/contact the nearest driver
4. Any other innovative means for direct booking
